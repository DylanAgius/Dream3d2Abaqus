# Dream3d2Abaqus
## Main Function
Convert microstructure information generated by Dream3d to construct an Abaqus input file containing periodic boundary conditions.

The generated microstructure features and orientations are assigned to element sets in Abaqus with the corresponding material definition assigned via sections.
## Dream3D Requirements
The minimum filter construction required is as follows:

Centroid information will be stored in the csv file, while node/element/orientation information is stored in the *.vox* file created using the filter *Export Los Alamos FFT File*
## Required informtion for Matlab function
To use the Matlab function, the *xlsx* file included here should be updated with the material parameters in the sheet (with the corresponding name) in the order provided in the pdf found [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jk2079/Kysar_Research_Laboratory/Single_Crystal_UMAT.html). 

The location of the centroid of each grain can be extracted from the generated *csv* file.  These values should be transferred to the *orientiation* sheet in the *xlsx* file (inputfile_info)
## Running the MATLAB function
To run the function, download all the files contained here and run from the command prompt using the following command:
*dream2abq('nameofvoxfile.vox','nameofinputfile.inp')*
where:
* nameofvoxfile = name of the vox file included in the same directly and which is exporting using the *Export Los Alamos FFT File* filter
* nameofinpfule = is the name of the Abaqus input file you would like to create
