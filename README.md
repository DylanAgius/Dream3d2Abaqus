# Dream3d2Abaqus
## Main Function
Convert microstructure information generated by Dream3d to construct an Abaqus input file containing periodic boundary conditions.

The generated microstructure features and orientations are assigned to element sets in Abaqus with the corresponding material definition assigned via sections.
## Dream3D Requirements
The minimum filter construction required is as follows:

Centroid information will be stored in the csv file, while node/element/orientation information is stored in the *.vox* file created using the filter *Export Los Alamos FFT File*
## Required informtion for Matlab function
To use the Matlab function, the *xslx* file included here should be updated with the material parameters in the sheet  in the order corresponding to that provided in the pdf found [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~jk2079/Kysar_Research_Laboratory/Single_Crystal_UMAT.html).
